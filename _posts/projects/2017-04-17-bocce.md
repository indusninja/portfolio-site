<p>The Gods Must be Crazy is a single player game where players have the objective of destroying life in the solar system by engaging with a simple solar physics system of frictionless motion in space which is guided by gravity of several celestial bodies. Each level provides new solar systems with their unique hurdles for the player to overcome. The human population spreads in a pattern where once a planet is filled with people, a spaceship is launched to spread life within that solar system. If no more planets are left to inhabit, then the spaceship will leave the solar system, meaning that the player has lost. The tools in the player's arsenal to stop them are meteors and solar flares. Meteors can be launched from a meteor field by selecting a direction and some speed. These use up higher energy from the “divine power” bar as compared to solar flares, but have higher damage. Solar flares are fired from the sun to the point where the player right-clicks.</p>
