<p>AI controller for a real-time strategy (RTS) game requires several AI techniques to work together at all times such as unit level controllers and overall strategy controllers. In application, RTS bots have a reputation for being extremely predictable and hence, human players find them very easy to beat. In this project, our group decided to create several different kinds of AI controllers for <em>Starcraft: Brood War</em> game. My role on the project was to evolve a unit controller (using Genetic Algorithm) that would be able to control any unit in the game (except controlling special spell-casting powers).</p>
