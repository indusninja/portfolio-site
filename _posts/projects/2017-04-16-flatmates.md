<p>Snowball Fight is a multiplayer-only First Person Shooter (FPS) game developed using the Unreal Engine (UDK). Players take on the role of kids who are fighting across a snow covered playground. Teams are trying to dominate the area in the center of the playground. Players can use snow for both offensive as well as defensive play. Snow can be thrown at opponents to ‘knock them out’ or be used to build snow walls which offer protection and strategic flexibility. The snow needed for those actions can be gathered by simply crouching on a snow covered landscape. When players have taken too many snowball hits, they can warm themselves with a glass of hot cocoa and get back to the playground.</p>
<p>The development team constituted of 7 members, out of which 3 were programmers. I had the role of Technical Lead in the project due to my prior knowledge of the game engine.</p>
