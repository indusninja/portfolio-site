<p>The goal for the project was to design a modular and re-usable game engine. The project was done as part of the process to familiarize with OpenGL. It began with initial work done on the Mini-Golf game. After some progress was made on the game, many of it’s functionalities were refactored into a DLL file which constituted the final engine.</p>
<p>The Mini-golf game built using GnomeEngine is a single-player 3D game where players have to clear a sequence of holes on the course. Player’s aim is to clear each hole in the minimum number of shots he can.</p>
