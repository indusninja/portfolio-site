<p>The game was developed as part of the Global Game Jam 2010, where participants have to develop a game within 48 hours. The gameâ€™s premise is that the player has to dodge enemies, find the key and get to the door to escape the level. And do it all over again in the next level. The game is build as a 2D tile based world where grass tiles are passable but tiles representing trees are not.</p>
<p>The only tools available to the player are to hide out of sight of the enemy, and deploy a dummy of himself. In such a case, enemies will not known the difference between player and his dummy, and will attack the closest one of the two, giving ample time for the player to find a new hiding spot. The game has a simple menu system build into it, which takes the player through each level in case of success or allows him to player the same level again if he failed to clear it in the earlier attempt.</p>
