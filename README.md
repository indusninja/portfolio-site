# Curation of Projects

This is the code for a website that I'm building to curate and collect all my projects. The project is currently under development...

The site is built using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) and uses the minimalist [pineapple theme](https://github.com/arnolds/pineapple) from [arnolds](https://github.com/arnolds). The build and deployment of the site is handled via [netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).
